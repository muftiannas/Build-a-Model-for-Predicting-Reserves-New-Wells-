# Build a Model for Predicting Reserves in the New Wells Oil Company

You work for an oil mining company called OilyGiant. Your task is to find a suitable location for digging a new oil well.
Here are the steps for selecting a new location:
- Collect parameters for building oil wells in selected areas: oil quality and volume of oil reserves;
- Create a model that can predict the volume of oil reserves in new wells;
- Choose the oil well with the highest estimated value;
- Select the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells;

You have oil sample data from three regions. The parameters of each oil well in the area are known. Create a model that will help you select the territories with the highest profit margins. Perform an analysis of potential profits and risks using bootstrapping techniques.
